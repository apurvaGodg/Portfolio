# APURVA GODGHASE

With an interest in analyzing consumer behavior and data trend, I enjoy storytelling with Statistics and Business Intelligence. My areas of expertise revolve around programming for data analysis, databases, visualization, big data and AWS.

I am someone who’s insatiably curious about anything and everything under the sun. I believe I am a self -starter with a tenacious approach towards learning new things! 

I believe, I amassed many of these skills from my 2+ years of work experience with the Marketing analytics, big data, and Product development.
